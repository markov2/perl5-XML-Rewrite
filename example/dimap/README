This example contains a real-life set of schemas, but in a pre-release
version.  This set is excellent in demonstrating the possibilities of
rewrite.

Have a look at the two steps taken in the 'norm' script.  I hope for
you that you do not need the "repair" step, because in that case you
need quite some understanding of schema's... at least more than the
schema developers themselves.
